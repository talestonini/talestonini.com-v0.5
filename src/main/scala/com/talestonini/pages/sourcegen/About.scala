      <p>I started this website to share my interests and learnings and as a way to play around with Scala.js. These are some of
      the technologies and libraries that I use to build it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala 2.13</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.scala-js.org/">Scala.js</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala">ThoughtWorks Binding</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://planet42.github.io/Laika/">Laika</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/firebase/cloud-firestore">Cloud Firestore</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">W3.CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://prismjs.com/index.html">PrismJS</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <strong>source code is open</strong> <a href="https://github.com/talestonini/talestonini.com">in my GitHub account</a> and I would gladly
      receive feedback about it.</p>
      <p>As you can see, I built a little engine to generate Scala.js code for the posts I write in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="_0-2-x" class="section">0.2.x</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Replaced <a href="https://github.com/hmil/RosHTTP">RÃ¶sHTTP</a> for <a href="https://http4s.github.io/http4s-dom/">http4s-dom</a> due to the
        former not being maintained anymore and to give me a reason to play with <a href="https://typelevel.org/cats/">Cats</a>. This is at
        the database layer, implementing API calls to Cloud Firestore.</li>
        <li>Packaging the app with <a href="https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler/">scalajs-bundler</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="_0-3-x" class="section">0.3.x</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Added links that allow for sharing a post via LinkedIn and Twitter, and also for copying a post URL to the clipboard.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="_0-4-x" class="section">0.4.x</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Refactored database package to remove usage of <strong>Future</strong> in favour of <strong>Cats IO</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="_0-5-x" class="section">0.5.x</h3>
      <ul>
