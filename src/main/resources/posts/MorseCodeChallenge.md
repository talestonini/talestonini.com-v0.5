This is the second code challenge I developed for [Eliiza](https://eliiza.com.au) as we continue to grow our *data
engineering* practice.

This time we want to expand our [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) skills, so in this challenge candidates are
asked to decode a **stream of Morse Code messages** with some old news headlines.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/eliiza/challenge-morse-code)!  Would you give it a crack?
