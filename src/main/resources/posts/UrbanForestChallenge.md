When I started at [Eliiza](https://eliiza.com.au) in September 2018, I was the first *data engineer* of the team,
among a few machine learning engineers, data scientists, our CTO and CEO.  We were only 7 people in total then and
wanted to grow.

This is the first code challenge that I developed to recruit other data engineers like myself, i.e. *software engineers*
that appreciate solving *Big Data* problems, distributed systems and parallel programming.  As such, it requires the use
of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) to determine the **greenest suburb of Melbourne**.

Check it out [here](https://github.com/eliiza/challenge-urban-forest)!  Would you give it a crack?
