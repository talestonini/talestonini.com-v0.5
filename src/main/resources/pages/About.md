#About the website
I started this website to practice writing about things I do at work, general interests in Software Engineering and as a way to learn ScalaJS.
These are some of the technologies and libraries that I build it with:

- [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
- [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/)
- [ThoughtWorks Binding](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala)
- [Laika](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/firebase/cloud-firestore)
