#About my website

I started this website to share my interests and learnings and as a way to play around with ScalaJS. These are some of
the technologies and libraries that I use to build it:

- [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
- [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/)
- [ThoughtWorks Binding](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala)
- [Laika](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/firebase/cloud-firestore)
- [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)
- [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/index.html)

The **source code is open** [in my GitHub account](https://github.com/talestonini/talestonini.com) and I would gladly
receive feedback about it.

As you can see, I built a little engine to generate ScalaJS code for the posts I write in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

##A note on data privacy and transparency

My website is hosted by **Firebase** (a platform that is owned by Google) and has **Google Analytics** enabled, so that
I can track visits to my pages and posts. I also allow visitors to login via some social media platforms (GitHub,
Twitter, Google and Facebook), which allows visitors to leave comments on the posts and soon to leave likes on them too.
I do not do anything special or malicious with the data I collect about visitors and visits, other than satisfy my own
curiosity about which posts attract more attention. For the sake of full transparency, this is what I collect:

- Count of visits per page (not linked to visitors);
- Personal identifiers that visitors utilise in their social media accounts used to log into my website;
- Comments (and soon likes) left on the posts by logged-in visitors.

#Release Notes

###0.2.0
- Replaced [RÃ¶sHTTP](https://github.com/hmil/RosHTTP) for [Http4s-DOM](https://http4s.github.io/http4s-dom/) due to the
former not being maintained anymore and to give me a reason to play with [Cats](https://typelevel.org/cats/). This is at
the database layer, implementing API calls to Cloud Firestore.
- Packaging the app with [scalajs-bundler](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalajs-bundler/).

###0.2.1
- New post [Refactoring the database access layer](https://talestonini.com/#/dbLayerRefactor).

###0.2.2
- Fixed typos.
