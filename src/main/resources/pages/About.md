#About my website
I started this website to share my interests and learnings in Software Engineering and as a way to play around with ScalaJS.
These are some of the technologies and libraries that I used to build it:

- [Scala 2.13](https://www.scala-lang.org/)
- [ScalaJS](https://www.scala-js.org/)
- [ThoughtWorks Binding](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala)
- [Laika](https://planet42.github.io/Laika/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/firebase/cloud-firestore)
- [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp)
- [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/index.html)
